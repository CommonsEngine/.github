# üß≠ CommonsEngine Governance

CommonsEngine is an **independent, open collective** of contributors building the infrastructure for digital self-determination.  
Our governance model balances openness with responsibility ‚Äî ensuring that every voice can contribute while maintaining technical and ethical integrity.

---

## üå± Principles

Our governance is guided by these shared principles:

- **Transparency** ‚Äî All major discussions and decisions happen publicly.  
- **Merit through contribution** ‚Äî Influence comes from consistent, meaningful participation, not titles.  
- **Consent over control** ‚Äî Decisions aim for consensus; if not possible, consent of affected maintainers.  
- **Accountability** ‚Äî Everyone, including stewards, is answerable to the community.  
- **Sustainability** ‚Äî Stewardship includes caring for people, not just code.
