# 🌱 CommonsEngine Code of Conduct

CommonsEngine is an open collective built on cooperation, transparency, and respect.  
We strive to create a community where contributors from all backgrounds can collaborate freely and safely to build the infrastructure for digital self-determination.

This document defines how we work together — in code, in conversation, and in shared responsibility.

---

## 💚 Our Values

We believe in:

- **Freedom through design** — technology should empower, not control.  
- **Mutual respect** — we are comrades, not competitors.  
- **Transparency** — discussions, decisions, and code should remain open.  
- **Kindness** — critique ideas, not people.  
- **Accountability** — everyone, including maintainers, follows the same rules.  

We recognize that collaboration across borders, languages, and perspectives makes our work stronger.  
Our diversity is not a challenge to manage — it is the foundation of the commons we are building.

## 🤝 Expected Behavior

To maintain a healthy environment, we expect everyone to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.

- Offer constructive feedback and accept it gracefully.  
- Focus on what is best for the community, not personal agendas.  
- Assume good intentions, but take responsibility for impact.  
- Respect privacy, consent, and data protection in all interactions.
