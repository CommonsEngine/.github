## 🌍 Vision

CommonsEngine is an open initiative to build the software foundations of the **digital commons** — systems that protect privacy, foster cooperation, and preserve human agency in the networked age.

We create technologies that serve as **alternatives to centralized platforms**, empowering individuals and communities to own their data, host their tools, and govern their digital spaces collectively.

## 🧩 What We Build

- **Privacy-first infrastructure** for collaboration and publishing  
- **Federated identity & access systems** that respect user agency  
- **Open frameworks** for autonomy and community governance  
- **Developer toolkits** for self-hosted and interoperable software

## 🧠 Principles

1. **Freedom through design** — software should expand human choice, not limit it.  
2. **Transparency by default** — open code, open governance, open documentation.  
3. **Privacy as agency** — control over data equals control over destiny.  
4. **Interoperability** — protocols before platforms.  
5. **Cooperation over competition** — we build together, not against.

## 🌱 Governance

CommonsEngine is an **independent, open collective** of developers, designers, and researchers dedicated to building the infrastructure for digital self-determination.
While inspired by the vision of the [Sovereign Manifesto](https://github.com/kasunben/Sovereign/blob/main/MANIFESTO), CommonsEngine operates autonomously — guided by **shared principles, not institutional ties**.

All projects are **community-governed, open-source**, and developed in the spirit of the **digital commons**.
