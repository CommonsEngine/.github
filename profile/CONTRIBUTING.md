# 🤝 Contributing to CommonsEngine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CommonsEngine** — the open framework powering the digital commons.  
We welcome contributions from developers, designers, researchers, writers, and anyone who shares our vision of **privacy, autonomy, and cooperation** in technology.

## 🌍 Guiding Principles

We believe technology should serve people, not platforms.  
Our work is grounded in the principles expressed in the [`Sovereign Manifesto`](https://github.com/kasunben/Sovereign/blob/main/MANIFESTO), including:

1. **Freedom through design** — software should expand human choice, not limit it.  
2. **Transparency by default** — open code, open governance, open documentation.  
3. **Privacy as agency** — control over data equals control over destiny.  
4. **Interoperability** — protocols before platforms.  
5. **Cooperation over competition** — we build together, not against.

---

## 🧭 Governance Overview

CommonsEngine is an **independent, open collective** of developers, designers, and researchers dedicated to building the infrastructure for digital self-determination.
All decisions are made transparently through open discussion and consensus.  
There is **no institutional ownership** — only shared responsibility.

Some commercial services (such as *Sovereign SaaS*) may use CommonsEngine software under open licenses,  
but **development of the core framework remains fully community-governed and open-source**.

## ✅ Code Guidelines

- Follow the project’s style guide (see `/docs/conventions.md` if present).
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive.
- Write clear, maintainable code — others will build on it.
- Use English for code, comments, and commit messages.
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless justified.

---

## 🧪 Testing

If the repository includes tests:
```
npm test
```

Pull Requests must pass all tests and linting checks before review.

---

## 🪶 Writing and Documentation

Documentation is as valuable as code.

- Use concise, inclusive language.
- Explain _why_, not only _how_.
- Markdown preferred (.md) for all docs.
- Visuals are welcome — diagrams, screenshots, etc.
- Keep API references and guides up to date with the latest version.
