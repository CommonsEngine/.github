# 🔒 Security Policy

Security and privacy are core to the mission of **CommonsEngine**.  
We design and maintain our software with the conviction that technology must protect user agency, not compromise it.

This document explains how to report vulnerabilities, what to expect, and how we handle disclosures.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

- **Privacy is agency** — safeguarding user data is a moral and technical priority.  
- **Transparency builds trust** — issues are resolved openly whenever responsible to do so.  
- **Responsible disclosure** — coordinated reporting prevents harm while ensuring accountability.  
- **No retaliation** — good-faith research and reporting are always welcomed.

## 📨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any CommonsEngine project:

1. **Do not** open a public issue or discussion.  
2. Instead, send a detailed report to:

   **📧 mailtokasun[at]gmail.com** *(will replace with org address later)*

   Please include:
   - Project and version affected  
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability  
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept  
   - Suggested mitigation (if known)  
   - Your contact information for follow-up

3. You will receive acknowledgment within **48 hours** and a more detailed response within **5 business days**.

---

## 🧩 Scope

This policy applies to all repositories under the **CommonsEngine** GitHub organization, including:

- Core infrastructure projects (e.g. `Sovereign`, `PaperTrail`)  
- Documentation sites, deployment scripts, and SDKs  
- Related containers, APIs, and integration tools  

Security reports related to **third-party dependencies** should also be sent here — we will coordinate disclosure with the upstream maintainers.

---

## ⚙️ Disclosure Process

1. **Triage** – The report is reviewed by maintainers and stewards to verify impact.  
2. **Mitigation** – A fix or patch is prepared in a private branch.  
3. **Coordinated release** – Updates are pushed to public repos and announcements are made once users can upgrade safely.  
4. **Acknowledgment** – Researchers who responsibly disclose issues may be publicly credited (unless anonymity requested).

---

## 🕊️ Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

We aim to resolve and publicly disclose vulnerabilities within **30 days**, though complex issues may require more time.  
If disclosure deadlines must shift, we will communicate transparently with the reporter.

---

## 🧱 Supported Versions

Security fixes are generally backported to the **latest two minor versions** of each actively maintained project.  
Older versions may not receive updates but can be forked and patched by the community under the same open license.

---

## 🔐 Encryption

If you wish to encrypt your report, request our current **PGP public key** via the security email above.  
Encrypted communication is encouraged for all sensitive reports.

---

## 🌍 Public Advisories

When a security issue is resolved, we will publish a **Security Advisory** in the affected repository using GitHub’s advisory system, detailing:

- The issue and its severity  
- Versions affected and fixed  
- Mitigation or upgrade instructions  
- Acknowledgments (if applicable)

---

## 🤝 Responsible Research

We welcome collaboration with independent security researchers, academic institutions, and civic-tech groups.  
Testing within responsible boundaries — without exploiting or disclosing user data — is encouraged and appreciated.

---

## 🧾 Legal Safe Harbor

CommonsEngine pledges **no legal action** against individuals who:
- Report vulnerabilities in good faith.  
- Follow this policy and avoid harm.  
- Respect privacy and data boundaries.  

We see ethical security research as part of the commons itself.
